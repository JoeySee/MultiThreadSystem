- How many threads are you going to use? Specify the work that you intend each thread to perform.
I intend to have one thread per train.

- Do the threads work independently? Or, is there an overall "controller" thread?
There will not be a controller thread.

- How many mutexes are you going to use? Specify the operation that each mutex will guard.
All data will be stored in copies of a template struct with pointers to fields similar to the tutorial code.
As such, I will use a single mutex to regulate all modification to this struct.
I also will need a mutex to identify when a train is crossing the track.

- Will the main thread be idle? If not, what will it be doing?
It will be idle.

- How are you going to represent stations (which are collections of loaded trains ready to depart)? That is, what type of data structure will you use?
Pair of priority queues representing east- and west-bound traffic.

- How are you going to ensure that data structures in your program will not be modified concurrently?
Convars and condition double checking

- How many convars are you going to use?
1. load_to_queue

2. send_to_track

- Describe the condition that the convar will represent.
- Which mutex is associated with the convar? Why?
- What operation should be performed once pthread_cond_wait() has been unblocked and re-acquired the mutex?


- Briefly sketch the overall algorithm you will use. You may use sentences such as:
