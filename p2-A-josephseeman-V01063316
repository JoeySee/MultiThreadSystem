- How many threads are you going to use? Specify the work that you intend each thread to perform.
I intend to have one thread per train.

- Do the threads work independently? Or, is there an overall "controller" thread?
There will not be a controller thread.

- How many mutexes are you going to use? Specify the operation that each mutex will guard.
Two to track if the priority queues representing the stations is being modified.
One to track if the count of trains standing by for queueing is being modified.
One to track if a train is crossing the track.

- Will the main thread be idle? If not, what will it be doing?
It will be idle after all threads are created and timer start signal is sent.

- How are you going to represent stations (which are collections of loaded trains ready to depart)? That is, what type of data structure will you use?
Pair of priority queues representing east- and west-bound traffic.

- How are you going to ensure that data structures in your program will not be modified concurrently?
Convars and condition checking.

- How many convars are you going to use?
1. loading_done
    - Sent when loading of a train into its queue is completed.
    - Tied to one of the station mutexes.
    - Should attempt to begin next load into queue.

2. sending_done
    - Sent when a train crosses the track.
    - Tied to the crossing mutex.
    - Determine if train of current thread should cross and send it if it should.

3. timer_start
    - Sent when all threads are loaded
    - N/A
    - Tells threads to start their local timers.


- Briefly sketch the overall algorithm you will use.
Main thread generates the structs for each train and passes them to threads. Each thread waits for it's loading time then inserts itself into its station's queue. They then wait for the loading of all trains to be completed and for the main track to be free, and proceed across the track if it is at the front of its queue and does not have to yield.
